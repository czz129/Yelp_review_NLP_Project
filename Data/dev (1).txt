300	adjudicated	3	This is a great place to visit if you enjoy large crowds and overspending.  They have plenty of delicious deli and bakery items available but you generally can't see either case over crowds while you wait, and if you don't know your order immediately when your numbers called you are S.O.L! They will very quickly call the next person in line so my advice would be to arrive the second they open so that you actually stand a chance of seeing the cases.  It's a great place for extroverts, but it's very small and very very full of people, so if you're the type of person who is not into that sort of thing, I would probably try to go in the most non-peak hours you can.
301	adjudicated	3	Hickory Hollow really isn't that bad. If you don't count that shooting earlier this year that is. I'm being serious here. I really don't think the area is all that bad, so I don't know if it is just fear that keeps people from frequenting here or what. It could soon be because of lack of stores, several have closed shop within the last year.   They have I'd say a 50/50 split in stores like New York & Company to get work clothes and urban stores. As far as I know right now, they still have a Victoria's Secret and Waldenbooks, what more could a dorky girl want in a mall right? Because of the low attendance you'll have no problem finding sales. It's really sad to think this place may be heading in the direction of other malls in the city.
302	adjudicated	3	Chris was our server and he was great. He seemed like the easy going kind of guy you'd want to hang out with. He gave us great recommendations and checked on us frequently.   The food was great. I had the Piggy Mac. Pulled pork topped with rich gouda mac and cheese sprinkled with panko and baked to a crispy brown. I ended up spooning the mac to the side so I could add Puckett's own sweet, yet spicy BBQ sauce to the tender, juicy pork.  My son (he's eight but eats like a teen) ordered the meat plus two veggies kids plate. He said the green beans were the best he's had and loved the pulled pork without and sauce.   We ate early so we missed the music (get there around 8pm) but the place has great lighting and atmosphere no matter the occasion.   Also, park in the back behind Frothy Monkey. It's free and has more space than on the street.
303	adjudicated	3	I really hate having to give Lucky Belly a 3 star, but when it comes down to a restaurant review, it's all about the FOOD.  I had my 30th birthday party here.  We had a living social deal for 2F upstairs.  I loved the privacy and karaoke! We had such a blast in our own private area. I loved the patio and string lights, where we had dinner.  Our host was amazing as well, but the food not so much.  I have never not finished a burger.  This was a first for me.  I ordered the jalapeno burger, and it was just smothered in sauce, overpowering everything.  We ordered all of the appetizers to share with our guests, and the tuna devlied eggs was the best thing I ate.  The korean wings were way too sweet and the hot chicken springs rolls was just not good, at all.  I can't say I will go back because I was so disappointed in the food. But I may go back to sing a song or two.
304	adjudicated	4	We went on a friday evening around 5:30 and were seated outside on the covered patio right away. We ordered 2 apps and a flight. The chorizo nachos were huge and decent but the trout dip with pita bread chips is what stood out! The dip came out with 6 pieces of bread placed in a circle around the dip. I asked how much it would cost to get an order of more pita bread and guess what... it was free! score!  Since both items were appetizers they came out in a matter of 5 minutes. All around it was a wonderful experience with good weather, great service, good food and a flight with information about each beer!
305	adjudicated	2	Ordered their chicken fajita and fish chips.  Chicken was really good, fish and chips not so much. Portions sizes were too little, for the price I would expect a little more. Drinks were alright.
306	adjudicated	1	All the food is pretty lack luster. Carne asada fries are less than lack-luster. The tacos are tiny, which would be fine if they didn't cost so much.
307	adjudicated	2	Three stars is pretty much on the money. I don't understand a Margaritaville in Nashville but I also am probably not the actual target demographic of these places...see: my dad who sometimes makes me think he can't find anything else on his XM radio other than Margaritaville.   So we've of course been to the one in the Caymans and on Key West. Since clearly these are out of the way places, I didn't get in the way of my parents having their experience here.   I was kind of hoping to avoid listening to music...or at least if I was going to have to listen to covers, NOT "Call Me Maybe" gone country. It's somewhat loud in here and I imagine as the night goes on it's louder. We were here prior to a hockey game but it was still pretty busy.   Since I procured my family a free app coupon I decided I was worthy of the 5 o'clock somewhere which is a take on a Hurricane, which somehow in five years of legal drinking I have never had before. It wasn't bad. I imagine it's one of those things where you're like "oh this barely tastes like alcohol, I'll have another" and then suddenly you're hitting on someone you shouldn't be hitting on. Wait what.  For that free app, we had the spinach artichoke dip. It wasn't bad, I certainly wouldn't have let anyone pay full price for it though.   I wasn't feeling like having a full on sandwich or anything but there aren't really any smaller sized options. I guess a cup of soup but I had had soup for lunch and it was like obscenely hot for December so that was out of the question. I decided to just get the chicken quesadilla app and if I didn't finish it then whatever. The rest of my family had burgers or a chicken sandwich. The burgers were liked all around, although my brother got the diablo one and complained that it wasn't spicy enough. But I don't think he understands that poblanos aren't that hot.  The quesadilla wasn't bad, there were some spots though where the chicken was a bit tough. Nothing you can't fix with a good bit of salsa though.   Even though like I said it was pretty busy, we were there only about an hour. Service was great. Would I come back on my own? Probably not. In my case it's really one of those places where once is enough for the experience but if I were asked to come again, I wouldn't say no.
308	adjudicated	3	If you're a fan of sweets, this spot is worth visiting.  They're well-known for their pralines, but there are plenty of other desserts to choose from here.  They even have guys in the front (or back?) of the store making pralines that you can watch.
309	adjudicated	3	Two years ago Florida Georgia Line came to town right around my birthday. Radio, TV and all over social media, all I saw was the concert. I figured it was impossible to not know about it, and I also figured my wife would be taking us to see the show for my birthday surprise. Sadly, I was wrong, and the show came and went, leaving me waiting for another opportunity to catch these guys live.  Finally, that day came, and I took matters into my own hands this time! I scored a pre-sale code and bought two great seats, only to find out my wife would be out of town the night of the show. Lucky for me I had a great friend decide to join me for the show, and what a show it was!   In addition to the sweet sounds of Cadillac 3 and Cole Swindell, who played all the hits, Florida Georgia Line brought the energy, the stage game, and every one of the songs you wanted to hear. But the best part had to be the two incredible surprises! In the second half of the show they walked down a catwalk to a second stage at the rear of the auditorium and played a set with Cole Swindell and Cadillac 3, including some homages to their country mentors, like "Back At Mama's" by Tim McGraw! This was trumped only by the encore, when they talked about the songs they identified with as kids and then performed them! Songs like Montell Jordan's "This is how we do it", Backstreet Boys "Everybody", Alan Jackson's "Should Been A Cowboy" and Papa Roach "Last Resort", and then they closed it all up with "Cruise".  3 Stars because of the insanely long wait for a bar. I think that's a shame. It's an event center. They should know how to do this by now.   Otherwise the place is great. Solid sound, comfortable seats and clean.
310	adjudicated	3	The food was pretty good, although our appetizer came out about 1 minute before our food did, which was a little frustrating. The guacamole was very good, however my chicken tacos could have been better.   Service was okay, not bad, but definitely not great. It seems like the whole staff is very young and may not have as much restaurant experience. However, the GM was very attentive and definitely treated all the guests with respect.
311	adjudicated	2	Wawa is what it is. A convenient store that has an array of options.  The prices are reasonable. Their food is only okay though. I've had their sandwiches a few times. My biggest gripe is I do not like their tomatoes. I think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard. I could be wrong about the reason, but they are hard none-the-less.  They also have a few pre-made hot items. The hot dogs are okay. But it's hard to mess up a hot dog. They hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average. Cheap and quick but so not worth it.  Go hear for a candy bar, drink, or other package snack item. Don't go here for anything that's actually prepared by them. It's just not that good.
312	adjudicated	2	I really liked the place however they need a bus boy at the pool people left their dirty plates and no one came to pick them up there were dirty dishes everywhere when we got to the pool it was gross!
313	adjudicated	3	I came here with my husband and some friends to grab some drinks and hang out. Upon walking in, we were greeted kindly by a man, who we never saw again. We sat and waited, checking out their menu. The waitress/bartender came up and asked if we were ready to order, but since part of our party was missing, we asked if we could have a few minutes. Well, I guess a few minutes means twenty because our waitress sat at a table conversing with a couple instead of coming back to assist us. The whole place was rather dead, probably since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Finally, she came over to take our orders. She was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu. We got margaritas all around. I had a mango margarita (I tried it both on the rocks and blended) and it was absolutely delicious! I would return just for their fabulous Mango margarita. I heard both their strawberry and traditional margaritas were just as good as well! (Just a tip, avoid the banana margarita!) It took our waitress forever to check on us again and we ended up going up to the bar anytime we needed something. We didn't even think about ordering food, considering the service we were receiving wasn't ideal. The drinks were good and our waitress was polite, just not very attentive. I still enjoyed my experience here and would consider coming back! Infact, I see another mango margarita in my future.
314	adjudicated	3	Good beer. Much better than most beer made in STL. Sweet. If you love sweet.   Ambiance is sterile. No vibe. Looks like an office building. destination spot.
315	adjudicated	3	I was looking for a restaurant in the city that offered a good steak at a reasonable cost.  I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.    The Good: I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.     The Not So Good: The decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?  If you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.
316	adjudicated	3	Comfortable room with a awesome guitar swimming pool.  Short trip to downtown. Rooms are clean and staff are friendly.
317	adjudicated	2	My group came on a rainy night so maybe we missed what all the fuss is about. Felt like there were too many rules- no moving bar stools onto the patio - you order first but then find a place to sit and come back to get a number for your food. No smoking allowed outside on the patio. Really really slow service. Ambiance was only ok... music inside was so loud you couldn't talk. ‍
318	adjudicated	2	LOVE this place and have a constructive suggestion. I have to start by saying I've loved this place for several decades and will love it forever! However, on my last visit while we were eating inside the restaurant, I picked up a visitor that was not appreciated one bit--a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER on my purse. I noticed it as I was picking my purse up to leave and found I had set it on a HUGE web. As I looked closer, that web was not alone--there were many. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get rid of these and clean regularly. I would like to eat my meals stress free! I would love to help clean this amazing place anytime.
319	adjudicated	2	Great food and drinks, albeit overpriced I had the salt of the earth cocktail and it had great flavor. The angry chicken chicken taco was good, but one wasn't very filling. We had the shiitake, lemon and cauliflower pizza as an appetizer and it had good flavor as well.
320	adjudicated	1	Tried this place because Pho 75 was closed at the time.  A nice suprise. Very clean and the menu was huge.  Im not a pho expert but it was a decent inexpensive meal.
321	adjudicated	2	The service was great and everything definitely tasted very fresh. I especially liked the guacamole!  I tried the mole and mango chicken tacos and I felt they lacked just a little bit of flavor. I'll definitely go back though and try some different varieties.
322	adjudicated	1	They got me in fast, but a little careless on scratching my brand new Shimano 105 crankset.  No apologies or offers to fix.  Just let it go.
323	adjudicated	2	Panda Express is like going to a jiffy lube - you KNOW there are much better places, and your leery about going to either but you still do because its so quick and easy!!!  Panda Express is OK and I love how they have the little stickers on the serving line swearing they use NO MSG - but you wonder why you bloat up after eating there???   Believe it not I dont have any complaints about Panda Express, I think its great, its just one of those places where if you choose to go here and its not good all you can do is slap yourself and ask yourself WHAT DID YOU REALLY EXPECT and go about your day!   One thing for sure - its is REALLY quick and thats perfect when your in a hurry!
324	adjudicated	3	You know what they say about sex or pizza; even when it's bad, it's good. 312 is not bad by any means! It just appears to be example of the growing trend of new restaurants in Nashville; price point does not match quality. This is based only on 2 experiences and is open to interpretation.  What it does do well is provide great service. The staff were friendly, accommodating & seemed genuinely interested in "serving" you well. And this goes a long way in my book.
325	adjudicated	2	J's Seafood Dock was not busy, quick to take our order, and had plenty of seating.   The jambalaya was really flavorful with just the right amount of heat, but very short on andouille and chicken. It had no shrimp in it at all.   'Real Creole Shrimp Tacos' were more like real creole lettuce tacos. Maybe we should have known because the sample did not have a lot of shrimp so we ordered at our own risk. Flavorful sauce and tasty tortillas though.
326	adjudicated	3	Based on previous experience, I chose Workshop for a meal with friends.  We reserved a table and since it was one of the last reservations of the night, the place was fairly empty.    Sadly the kitchen was slow.  We were the last table of the night and our mains took an hour to get to our table.  I ordered the pirogies (which have changed from a month or two back).  They were fairly cold, the side vegetables weren't cooked well and it was rather ho hum.  To drink I ordered a drink I had before, the Gin Gin Mule...I think they used tonic water instead of the ginger beer.  I'll try it again but this was definitely an off night.
327	adjudicated	3	I have been to this nail salon a few times over the past 3 mos. Their quality and service is slipping. This is too bad because I go here because it is so close to my work and easy for me to pop in on my way home.   It is still clean, friendly service, etc. No complaints there. But the quality of service is not as good. They are not as thorough and services have been rushed and sloppy.   One complaint is there is only one employee who does nails (other than manis) and this is a huge time suck.   Another is that my last pedi was rushed and not up to par. The woman did not trim the cuticles as well, remove dead skin, pay attention to detail, or do a thorough job. She went very fast and cut corners.  I got a full set, and a pedi. The man did the nails (which were fine/good except for some acrylic on the sides which he fixed later) and then she painted them. The polish job was sloppy. I had bare spots on the edges, lumps (old polish?) and overspill onto the sides and cuticles. She did not follow up with polish remover to clean them up - instead, as she painted, she ran her nail along the edges to remove it. Not quality.   I happen to like nail art once in a while - not every time - but sometimes I splurge. There does not seem to be anyone who does nail art well. There are many designs you can choose from on the hand models/boards but they are not recreated well. I chose one design for my big toes and it looked nothing like what I picked out. On an earlier visit, I had a picture of a design on my phone and was told point blank they couldn't do it - it was not complicated or too fancy. ??? I have witnessed other customers being disappointed in the nail art feature as well.   Overall, I think this place may be understaffed to meet demand and is struggling with consistent quality. They need another person who can do nails really well like the man does and they need to take their time/provide thorough service.
328	adjudicated	3	I have been to this location twice and the first time it was much better than last night. Simply, the beer is just ok. I love good beer but I will drink it whether I think it is amazing or awful. I got 4 of their current seasonal beers in a sampler (batch 100, winter warmer, undead black IPA and paramount). They were decent, nothing to write home about or come back the next day for. The reason they lose points from last night was because of the food, not the beer.  Got a black and blue burger. It had just too much blue cheese on the burger and the meat was just alright and they also skimped on the fries. The price is steep for their higher end food but I think their entrees are very good and will stick with those for next time.  P.S. For anyone looking to avoid big parties, babies and young kids (1-12 years old) I have always seen a big group of people who decide to bring their children with them. Kids never bother me but they are kids so they make noise and run around the restaurant. Not much you can do about it besides sitting at the bar.
329	adjudicated	3	Was invited by friends while visiting the area and was pleasantly surprised!  The food was good and while loud and crowded, we still had a great time!  Very reasonably priced for seafood and would recommend to anyone upon a visit to this part of Florida for a casual, laid back meal.  it isn't my favorite spot on the beach, but I do have a sentimental spot for it in my heart.
330	adjudicated	3	This is a struggle on this one. The interior is amazing it's 5 star cozy lodge feel with nice fireplace. So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.  The Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.  The Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.    The Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.  I am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.  Also side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.  PS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.  I really hope they make some of these suggested changes sooo much potential for go to spot.
331	adjudicated	2	I really enjoy the sushi here. It always taste so fresh and while their prices aren't the best, for what you get I'm pretty impressed. My husband always gets the teriyaki steak. Compared to other places the teriyaki steak is a little expensive for the quantity /quality. Service is always good, they keep your drinks filled and I have never had to wait too long for food. We don't go out of our way to go here, but if we are in the area we tend to stop in.
332	adjudicated	2	OK lunch buffet, but too oily.  i think weekend buffet is better than weekday.
333	adjudicated	1	I'll go back. Got a lb of brisket and a lb of pulled pork. Both were very very yummy. I'm shorting them stars for the sides, though. At the risk of sounding full of myself my Mac and Cheese is better. Also their burnt end beans were too heavy on the mustard for me. My kids dug their shoe string fries. I'll definitely go back for the meat. Maybe I'll give the coleslaw a try.
334	adjudicated	2	Oddly enough this is a decent location. Free multi floor parking was a plus in case of flooding. It has a decent gym, and a nice upstairs pool. Relatively easy on-off highway. A $14 Lyft to French Quarter's canal street. Concierge is minimalistic and oddly located in open area in front of elevators. I like the elevator key lock to the top floor.   But for some weird reason the prices in late October are rising above French Quarters, which I presume is a micro-market in Met'ree (that how they say Metairie ;-))
335	adjudicated	3	I'm from STL and sadly, I never had Ted Drewes until recently. I always see long lines so I figured I'd give it a try. I went to the location on South Grand and the ice was good but the service was terrible. The staff was rude and impatient while I tried to figure out what I wanted. Maybe I'll try the one on Hampton next time.
336	adjudicated	2	I gave The Mason Jar 3 stars for these reasons:   -They always get to-go orders incorrect. Always.  -The front of the house staff is not welcoming. They are sort of dreary.  -The menu is ok. Not a lot of diversity in the menu here. Standard American cuisine.   I do love the burgers however, and those dang garlic fries get me everytime! They are great for sharing.
337	adjudicated	3	Second time to visit Mazarin in three years.  Three years ago it was great, including the breakfast.    But this last visit, Dec 2016, not too good.  I never got an answer to three phone calls previous to the visit.  (Three different days and three different times of day) So, I emailed to request courtyard view.  My Superior bedroom was facing the courtyard but it did not view the courtyard.  I was put on the third floor which viewed  the top of a tarp that covered the courtyard during inclement weather.  Only the weather was not inclement ... I suppose they were too tired to remove tarp.  They are very busy. (Never got answer to email either)  We booked the room for two people and had to request two wash clothes each day since there were none.  The concierge never looked up from her PC to welcome guests and it would look better if she would smile. (She probably wasn't feeling well)  Doorman was great and the desk service was prompt.  The breakfast was not up to standard for a hotel of this price point.  It seemed cooked hours previously, then placed on steam trays.  Similar to what is served in La Quinta.  Eggs were scrambled and stiff, bacon was limp and chewy and all the breads were stale and cold.  Juice and coffee were fine.  We stayed three days but only ate breakfast there the first.  Even though breakfast cost was included in the room cost.  Hint to cooks: If you keep scrambled eggs on steam trays they continue to cook and become over done.  Also breads, bagels and croissants are baked fresh daily in the Quarter.  It would be good to serve it.  On the better side the rooms were very clean and when the drain in the shower was slow, leaving us standing in an inch of water, they sent maintenance man right away and repaired it.  Slept well every night  I am sorry but we will not be staying a third time and cannot recommend this hotel as a 4 or 5 star hotel.
338	adjudicated	3	Small menu, seems like a neighborhood diner atmosphere. We had the biscuits and gravy and the slinger, which comes with sausage instead of hamburger. Iced coffee is truly just black coffee served over large chunks of ice. Food was good, but nothing was great. Very small dining room with family style communal seating. First time trying, but probably won't be back.
339	adjudicated	3	Front end service was 5 stars and the space is elegant with an up scale feel. Wait staff was attentive and is well trained.  Back end was 2 stars, because entrees took very long and were unimpressive. Flavor was good but short on some ingredients. The veal special was just a breaded fried veal cutlet; no cheese, no sauce. Pappardelle with pork had almost no pork; tasted fine though. Chocolate hazelnut tort dessert took very long to expedite and preparation was inconsistent. We ordered 3 - there were 5 of us at the table - and one came with chocolate shavings, while 2 did not. One was also stuck to the plate and the crust was like stone.  They did comp us on the dessert, which was very nice considering the wait.   It's a nice place and they obviously put a lot of thought and money into the space, cuisine and concept. I hope they can work out the defects and execute on their vision.
340	adjudicated	2	My roommate and I began our best brunch search months ago and stumbled into Refuel when we first started. After going back a couple of times since, I can say the food is good and the ambiance is great but whole package isn't my top brunch spot in the city, or even in my top 5 (granted, there are a lot of brunch places in New Orleans).   I heard great things about their french toast so I went in with high hopes and was told they no longer serve it!! So, if you're in a sweet mood, get the Belgian waffle with all the goods on the side at no extra cost and share it with a trusted diner.   I'd be happy to return to check out their new menu, so hopefully that will up my brunch scale rating!
341	adjudicated	3	Let me point out that I do not eat oysters! I have been to this place a couple of times but only because I was with a group of friends.  The food here is good but certainly not the best creole food around. I like the gumbo here it is delicious and not watered down like most of the other restaurants in this city. The crab cakes here were good too!  The service was satisfactory. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was not as bad as some of the other places I dealt with in the French Quarter. So I guess it was okay to say the least.  One of the other things I like about this place is the unusual amounts of homeless wino's that pass out in front of this place. I kind of understand that this is the norm on Bourbon street. But it is comical to see a bum passed out in front of an upscale place like this. This place is really pricey, but given the fact it is an upscale place on bourbon street I totally understand why.  In short good food, mediocre service, pricey establishment and a magnet for drunks to pass out in front of!
342	adjudicated	1	A lil cozy bar/restaurant on Frenchman Street.  Small plates, good music and service.
343	adjudicated	2	I'm going to make the bold statement and say that I'm kind of an ice cream fanatic. Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don't care if it's the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I've been known to eat it for dinner.   With that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the "Bi-rite of the south" (best ice cream I've ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn't bad.   My main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you'd think they'd be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.  What I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can't buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the "Bi-Rite of the South" in my book).  All in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it's still great ice cream. And I'm sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)
344	adjudicated	2	Its a local deli. Prices are high, but that is the normal deal for places like this. They don't always put prices on their stuff which is sometimes annoying.  I go here often because it is close, all the employees are very friendly and they always pet my dog.
345	adjudicated	2	Good: view, breeze, weather on this day. Bad: understaffed, picnic tables as seating, and no drink menu. I think that the incredible weather and view save this restaurant from being 2 stars. The food was "okay", service was slow because they needed more staff. All in all I'd come back again for a beer to watch the sunset on a nice day, but not big on dinner here.
346	adjudicated	3	Totally agree with the other lone (and 1st) review, the staffing at this store is dysfunctional and the merchandising is poor at best.   And, to make matters worse many of the center-store packaged product prices are not competitive to other merchants in the area.  There are some perks, if you live nearby it's of course convenience.  The other nice perk is that Lancaster brand steaks are very good and at this Acme they're always fresh, good grill cuts, and they are very reasonably priced.
347	adjudicated	4	Fun fact, I "recently" moved somewhat close to the "Hill". In fact, on the day that I finally found my apartment, my parents and I were driving down the road and stumbled upon a building adorned with a big, red, flashing sign-it read, "Joey B's on the Hill." Since we were famished from all of the decision making, we decided to give it a whirl.  Now, Joey B's is not quite located in the same area as the rest of the Hill restaurants, so I was anxious to see what it was like-most of the others are sit down, semi-nice, lit by the light of 1,000 candles types of places. You know, your typical Italian joint--checkered table clothes and all.  Joey B's was a little different as it looked a little more like a sports bar than most other places on the Hill--fewer candles, more big screen TVs. [Of course, my father was extraordinarily pleased that he could watch the Nascar race while we ate, so it was all good.]  After looking over the menu, my mom decided to order the French Dip and my dad and I decided to split a pizza-half supreme, half BBQ chicken. That's half sausage, pepperoni, bacon, mushroom, green pepper & onion and half grilled chicken, red onion and provel cheese with BBQ sauce. Let's just be honest. This was a mistake. And the mistake was my fault. I was the one who ordered the BBQ half of the pizza and it just did not hold a candle to the "regular" half of the pizza.  Yes, I'll admit that for once in my life a pizza with provel cheese on it--impressed me. I didn't expect that! But, the BBQ pizza was too sweet and I'm sad to say that we didn't eat much of it.  Luckily, my dad let me have a little of his and I was so glad he did, because his half of the pizza was much better than mine.  The pizza had a nice crunchy crust, but it didn't crumble and fall apart like some thin crusts can. Plus, the sauce was really good. Nice and tangy. In fact, I believe that the menu said that this was Rachel Ray's favorite pizza sauce--and who can argue with that?  All in all, it was just good pizza. No, not the *best* I'd ever had, but good. Plus, it was pretty BIG too-definitely enough to share. So either go in expecting left overs or take a BIG appetite.  Now that we've talked pizza, let's talk about the [unexpected] best part of the meal. My mom's french dip sandwich.  Thin, juicy, sliced roast beef served with its own au jus and melted provel cheese on French bread. This sandwich was very moist and very flavorful. I would have to describe it as comfort food... to the point where I am seriously look forward to going there in the winter and having one.  Plus, once again, I'm proud to say that I enjoyed the provel cheese on this dish! *gasp!* Maybe St. Louis is stealing my soul.... Or maybe Joey B's just knows how to use juuuustttt enough provel to bring the flavor palette in without overwhelming the taste buds. Yeah, I'll go with the second option.  Other menu items that we selected included onion rings (very heavily breaded, but pretty good... your standard onion rings) and side salads (again, the provel cheese was good on these salads. Shocking!). It was all just very satisfying; a nice hearty, savory meal.  So, what's the final judgement? The food was good (and partially changed my mind about provel cheese), the service friendly, and the atmosphere upbeat but not super exciting. I'd have to grade Joey B's like this:  Food: A- Atmosphere: B Service: A Price: $ Portion Size: Large  It truly seemed like a great place to grab a pizza and a couple beers and hang out with your friends. I definitely plan on returning and you should check it out too. Let me know what you think when you go!  Happy eating!
348	adjudicated	3	Sundial is a much improved downtown retail and restaurant complex that is righting many of the wrongs of the former Baywalk. The design is much more open and more conducive to bringing people to and through the center core.  Now that Locale Market has opened for business I expect the flow of people day and night will definitely increase. More traffic means more vitality.  Three restaurants on the second floor will be opening in 2015. Farm Table Kitchen which is the upstairs dining component to Locale Market. Ruth's Chris Steak House will bring a nationally known brand to the mix and Sea Salt, which is expanding from its original location in Naples, Florida, should bring additional attention and spark to Sundial's dining options.  But the retail mix to date just does not do much for me because I can either find the same shops elsewhere - Tommy Bahama, Chico's and Lululemon athletic clothing - or the new-to-the-market or locally owned shops are limited in what they offer.  This is a lovely complex in the center of a lively downtown that should become a destination for food but also for other reasons that encourage spending time and spending money. Here's hoping the retail can be amped up enough to shine just as brightly as its neighboring foodie-focused businesses.
349	adjudicated	2	A great place for breakfast - the parking situation is a little difficult with them only having a small area for cars. I don't live nearby so it's always a task to get a good space. The times I've gone early in the morning it has been a little hectic and crowded. I will say - the food is delicious. The coffee is better than most i.e. Starbucks, Duncan Donuts - it's a cut above the rest!
350	adjudicated	2	This is a good place to get a take out lunch if you are in the mood for something healthy. I would not recommend eating there because seating is limited and there are crowds of people waiting to order/pick up their take out meals.  Rittenhouse Square is just a few steps away and that's where I go to eat my lunch.  The lady sitting next to me on the bench remarked how good my food smelled.   Everything on the menu at Hip City Veg is vegan, though even if you are not vegan/vegetarian I would recommend it because the food tastes really good!  I liked the Udon noodle salad with faux-chicken. I've also had the ziggy burger which I thought was pretty good for a veggie burger (loved the fresh tomato, lettuce and onion) but especially enjoyed the sweet potato fries I had as a side.  There are also some interesting drinks. There is a "groothie" which is a greens and fruit smoothie. Personally I thought it was just OK and not that thirst quenching, but it seemed like a lot of people were ordering it so I tried it.  I preferred the green lemonade (lemonade plus kale, sweetened with agave), which was both delicious and refreshing!   Overall I'd recommend Hip City Veg and plan to go back!
351	adjudicated	3	I had high expectations when I went to this place recently after some recommendations from friends.  We visited on a night when there weren't very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service.  I was a bit disappointed when I didn't find as much on the menu as I would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me.  I guess I have become very picky with my Yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment I go to pretty thoroughly.    I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of Ybor's lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.  I did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale.  Not a bad place to hang out and have a drink if you're looking for a lower key outing in the Ybor area.
352	adjudicated	2	Love this place with the vibrant colors on a Sunday morning after a night out! We loved the Bloody Mary bar, however they were out of almost everything and they didn't replace. Our waitress was not with it. We have 8 people and it was about a 2 hour trip, 30 min of that was her just trying to figure out the bills, credit cards and payments. It was bad.
353	adjudicated	1	Decent place for lunch. Overall service is good with friendly employees.
354	adjudicated	2	This is where I head when I get that Texas BBQ itch. The brisket sandwiches are delicious, when cooked properly, and the sangria had me feeling nice.   The atmosphere is relaxed. Nice bar seating.
355	adjudicated	2	15 microbrew taps, order food, pretty nice little bar but the Wi-Fi is so so slow slow slow. I love whole foods and have been to most of them in the western United States, it's a good bar but not a good value---come on, growlers $20 to $40????
356	adjudicated	2	Was in town looking for breakfast places and this place had a super high rating.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to ordering biscuits and gravy because I like the way I make them.  Lots of sausage in the gravy and a bit of pepper.  I gave it a try.  The sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice.  I didn't enjoy the biscuits.  They were very hard and smothering them in gravy didn't help much.  I also thought this place deserved more than one dollar sign.  It was a bit pricy.  All in all, pretty good.
357	adjudicated	2	This is a popular place to go for us students after exams on Friday. They have an excellent burger selection and the out door patio is now open for business. They have done a great job fixing it up. Live music outside and a decent selection of tap and bottle beers.  Enjoy
358	adjudicated	2	Hobnobber is close to my office, and the older male employees make a point to go here weekly. Possibly more than weekly. There really isn't a lot of variety around the 8000 block of Airline in Metairie. Hobnobber is somewhat close by on West Metairie Ave.  Anyway, in the ~2 years that I've worked at my current job, I hadn't tried Hobnobber. I'm not really a seafood fan and their menu consists of a lot of seafood entrees. If you like seafood, this might be the place for you. I finally gave in and accompanied some co-workers last week.   They recommended the Italian entrees, if I wasn't in the mood for seafood. I opted for the eggplant parmesan. While I didn't have high expectations, it was really quite good. I've had better, mind you, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, it was nice. Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).  If you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch. Also, if dining in, note that it's one of those places where you order at the counter, the server brings your food, and then you eat. They have a small, limited selection salad bar by the serve-yourself drink machine.  Overall, I wouldn't make the trip here if I had more time for lunch. But, in a pinch, it's good homemade food at a good price.
359	adjudicated	3	Cool touristy place right in the heart of it all.  I loved the fact that people were throwing beads in the restaurant through the windows and that floats were passing by as we ate.  However, the service we received was atrocious.  I'd cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor's note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn't sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.  Overall, the food was a 4+, but the service brought my rating down.  I felt like we got one of the only people on Bourbon St. NOT having a good time.
360	adjudicated	1	uhhhh the waitress was quite not so nice when i asked for to build my own sandwich with just veggies. i wish she would've known more about the vegan options but apparently she didn't have time and was quite rushed.
361	adjudicated	1	Its worth a go.  Although its not huge-trust me your kids will have fun.   Remember to Bring your own towels and I suggest you bring water shoes too. Very Cute-with a retractable roof-which is perfect for the winter time.   Place is kept well enough.   There is a baby/small toddler area with their own slide and water sprinklers.
362	adjudicated	2	I guess I'm listed as a "picky" reviewer on Yelp, but this place could be 4 stars if they would address the service problems. Walked in at 7:30, gave the name and waited. Soon there were over a dozen people standing in the waiting area for tables. After 15 minutes the lady I gave my name to came over and asked what the name was again. I asked if we could sit at the 2 top that had been vacant since we walked in and she looked at the empty table and said sure. Ok, but why couldn't we be seated before that??? I do want to add that in between taking names, she was answering the phone, pouring coffee, ringing up checks and bussing tables. This place sorely needs a host or hostess. The couple that came in right behind us waited over 20 minutes to be seated, AND there was another 2 top open behind us. I don't get it. Anyway, the waiter came by, opened the wine and told us about the specials. I guess its picky if you want the wine opened and then given a few minutes to relax before hearing the specials. Anyway, another man came by several minutes later and asked if we were told the specials. We asked for a few minutes and he was very nice and said sure no problem. I will get to the food, but you have to read what else took place to understand why they need someone to co-ordinate the staff. A waitress brought the appetizers and when we were almost done, yet another waitress brought us bread with dipping sauce. Been nice to get the bread first. The dinner was brought out by a different waitress. At the end of the meal the a waitress brought by the dessert cart , which we passed on. The original waiter stopped by to ask about dessert, I said no thanks, but we would like the check. In between we kept trying to get someone's attention because we had asked to take part of an entree home. The waiter was way to busy and basically blew us off, one of the waitress' also passed by, but we couldn't get her to stop. Finally the man that seemed to be the manager came by and he took care of it. Ok, that's the bad news and maybe they were shorthanded , but a lot of other Yelpers note the same problem with service issues. People shouldn't have to sit and wait 15-30 minutes for a table. If this wasn't BYO, then you could always go sit at a bar and have a drink. The other thing is, no one offered to open the wine while we were waiting,as many BYO's will do if they can't seat you on time. Nor, did anyone say sorry about the wait. The food was very good, even as picky as I am. The shrimp tempura was serving of 5 very large gulf shrimp atop a very flavorful asain slaw. The duo, which consists of a crabcake slider and a sirloin slider was great. The crabcake was moist and had ample pieces of lump crabmeat. The sirloin slider was excellent, could of eaten a lot of those. The entree's were also top notch. The special Grouper with beans and crab was moist, cooked perfectly and had a nice red pepper sauce on the bottom. As most of the reviews talk about here, the Lobster ravioli is as good as anywhere in this area. The pasta was light, the ravioli was stuffed with lobster meat and the sauce was great. Like I said, take care of the service and seating issues and this is a 4 star. They do have their own lot, but you probably will have to park across the street if it's a weened night. I was glad I put this address in the nav system because at night and the first time there it's a little hard to find. Will give them another try in hopes the service improves.
363	adjudicated	2	Love their juice double burgers with bacon and cheese. Their new location at la Cumbre Plaza offer even better burgers.
364	adjudicated	1	Decent, centrally located hotel but hurt by thin walls and poor attention to detail by the housekeeping staff.
365	adjudicated	1	Ate Here Today the appetizers are good. Had the  fried Calamari was very good! I had the pasta an didnt really like it.But ate it it was really  too much garlic.I"ll come here for the  appetizers!
366	adjudicated	3	Went out for a late dinner in a city we did not know very well, after a few blocks saw this very nice looking restaurant in a area with many bars but weren't in the mood for bar food...meatball app was great so was the gravy that came with it, the caponata was good too and burrata just needed some seasoning.  Ordered personal pizzas a margherita and then a clam/bacon but said panchetta on menu they both tastes great hot! But one cooled back at the hotel room tasted bad for some reason.  As a side ordered broccoli rabe which cost 6 bucks but the serving size looked like a 3 buck suggestion, the rabe was not bitter at all the freshest i'ver eaten prepared in oil and garlic just a bit too much red pepper flakes...but still damn good
367	adjudicated	2	Cute little date spot tucked away down town Edmonton.Good service and good food.Was very happy with the Venison tenderloin and blue cheese gnocchi.Plating was very nice and the cook on the Venison was very good.My wife loved the lobster tail as well!
368	adjudicated	2	Fantastic appetizers, average service, average main course.  As a couple we had calamari and steak carpaccio for appetizer.  Some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had.  Had langoustine with pasta and gnocchi.  Pasta didn't seem hand made.  Gnocchi was but was heavy.  Large portions.  Decor ok.  Looked like the back office was in the restaurant which was a little off-putting.  Will likely go back just, if just for the calamari!
369	adjudicated	2	Customer service is where it's at. Look at this place. Decent lunch and breakfast food. I mean it all tastes great but it's just basic stuff, nothing different from the trucks on campus. Except one thing.. RICHIE! He's the man, he's made himself a local celebrity on campus with his great attitude and awesome service. I'm telling you he's a genius because why do I choose to come here over any other place on campus? Richie of course.
370	adjudicated	1	Went on a Saturday around lunch time. Very quiet. I was about the only one there. Sushi was ok. Ordered the eel roll and the Screaming Tuna roll. The eel on the roll was minuscule and the roll was dominated by enormous pieces of cucumber. The tuna roll was better and topped with scallions and masago. The obligatory side of ginger (which I'm not sure is really necessary) was of the kind dyed red, completely unnatural. Ginger is pale yellow or tan colored. Cordial service by the only server but he seemed bored as did the chef behind the counter.  Might try again if I'm in the mood and in the area.
371	adjudicated	2	I really think Herbie's is more in the 3.5 stars range, and it could be bumped up to 4 after we try out their brunch (heard it's amazing!) or some of their cocktails that other reviewers raved about.  Not sure if this place is ever crowded, but it certainly was fairly empty on a Wednesday night, so we were seated immediately.  I love sitting in the patio area with the view of Euclid.  Food: 1) Corn Chowder (special) - heard it was pretty good. 2) Ligurian Shrimp Pasta - nice and fresh.  It def had a spicy kick to it, but not so much that someone like me who can't handle spiciness was able to enjoy a few bites.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly and were pretty large. 3) Lobster Mac & Cheese (special) - pretty good.  Not swamped in cheese, though it lacked a little flavor (nothing some salt didn't fix).  Pretty big pieces of lobster.
372	adjudicated	1	I'll never give 1 or 2 stars for a restaurant because I don't feel that does any good and it takes a lot to be that bad.  I just got home after ordering takeout and I ordered the buffalo grilled chicken wrap. Well it's only grilled chicken minus the buffalo sauce. Not a big deal, but for the life of me, I can't seem to get a to-go order that is right when I leave this place. I blame the cook not doing his or her job and lack of management oversight.   I think I've given up on to-go orders here.
373	adjudicated	2	Experienced this restaurant 8-04-2013 with friends. We decided to sit in the courtyard, which had a lovely ambiance. However the the square table for four was much more suited to a table for two, really felt cramped.  The wines we chose were really good we had the cabernet sauvignon and our friend had the malbec which she really enjoyed.  For Dinner I chose the Salmone Campagnolo, the mash potatoes were great however the salmon was definately overcooked and very dry and lacked flavor. Everyone else chose the Saltimbocca, which was also nothing special, have had better on the hill.   Visited August 2013
374	adjudicated	4	Was in Philly this past weekend. I usually stay in Center City but all the hotels in the area were sold out because of the Equality Forum. I scored a decent rate of $120/night + tax through Expedia.  In any event, I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. I checked in around 2:30pm. I was greeted by the handsome, energetic front desk clerk and directed to room 225.  While room 225 was definitely one of the larger rooms in the hotel, there's a reason for that. It was a double room designed for someone who uses a wheelchair. I was only staying one night so I didn't bother making a big fuss about it, but I did enjoy the larger size. Some of the accessibility "extras", like everything being REALLY low for easier access, took some getting used to. The bathroom area was equally huge, with easy access to the sink and closet area, as well as a water closet and roll-in shower tucked behind a huge sliding door. The shower itself had one of those detachable shower heads as well as a gym-shower style dispenser with body wash and shampoo.   As for the bed, other than being ridiculously low to the floor (again, for easier access for those in wheelchairs), it was pretty comfortable and I slept pretty soundly. The TV had a decent selection of HDTV channels. Complementary water and coffee was in the room, as well as a mini-fridge in the bathroom area in case you wanted to keep drinks or meds cool.   The parking fee was $9 with in/out privileges. You had to get a new ticket every time you entered and the front desk would stamp it when you wanted to leave the lot. The lot is pretty large and shared with two other Sheraton properties (They also run a shared shuttle in case you're going to or from the airport.).    I took a quick look at the pool area. It was pretty empty but again, it's early May and that's to be expected, I guess. There's not much choices for food onsite, other than a quick-service area that's a tad overpriced (again, to be expected). You can drive north maybe 5 minutes on Island Avenue for fast food if you needed to. The bar area looked fun, but again, it was pretty empty for a Saturday.  All in all, if I had to stay outside of Center City Philadelphia again, I'd probably stay here. They really should put one of these in Center City, if you ask me. It'd be perfect.
375	adjudicated	3	GET HERE EARLY.  This place gets packed  soon afterwards, and I am not lying when I tell you that the line for service can get a little intense.    Luckily, there is a sheet to sign in that lets the staff know who is set to go next, but when I went last Sunday, the girl that works the front desk wasn't in yet, the shop was super short-staffed, and it was basically pandemonium.  It reminded me of Mad Max at the Thunderdome as women hoarded nail polish shades, just to be sure they had a choice in the matter when their time came.  Seats were stolen, bitchy looks were exchanged, and it was just not pretty.    Once I made it to the back, only slightly worse for the wear, I received adequate service. Though it sort of goes without saying, I preferred the guy that did my manicure, who actually massaged my hands and arms, to the distracted girl that did my pedicure.  She was much more concerned with the Kardashians over her right shoulder and her cell phone in her lap to really worry about me.  She barely massaged my feet or legs at all, and, honestly, isn't that 90% of the experience?
376	adjudicated	1	If you want to get in and out quick, this KFC/Taco Bell is "ok" for a fast food place.    I went with my brother early evening, and got two hot wing boxes.  The chicken wings were a little over cooked and overpriced.  I wouldn't say you get a great value for portion sizes.  The hours are not late at this location.  The few times I have been here, the food hasn't so been great either... Overall, customer service is pretty good.    Go here if you're having a craving for either Taco Bell or KFC.   :) xoxo
377	adjudicated	2	We have been going here for three years now on a weekly basis and it is consistently good every time!  Tried almost everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad yet.  Patron margaritas are the best!  Chips and salsa are never ending!  Never too crowded and always seated quickly.  Friendly staff remembers us  ;)  Update:  place is going downhill now. :(.
378	adjudicated	2	The service here was great. Someone greeted me as soon as I walked in, the guy who took my order was very friendly, and the person who cleared my table asked me if I needed a refill or was just in general very cheery.  Not too impressed with the food though. The cucumber salad was delicious, so make sure you order that as your side - but admittedly it's a dish that's kind of hard to screw up. The wrap I got tasted okay, but it tasted like it was made in a microwave (not sure, maybe it was). In general the food reminded me of a mediterranean version of Panera. I don't like Panera either, so if you think the food there is awesome maybe you will like this place more than I did. The best way I can think to describe it is like the food you might get on a fancy mediterranean airline. It was edible and had some nice flavors, but just wasn't great. Without the very friendly service, I would have given this place 2 stars.
379	adjudicated	2	The chargrilled oysters are amazing! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is being the service was kind of terrible. My shrimp po boy was awesome, but my sister said her alligator po boy was just okay.
380	adjudicated	2	This is the best pizza by far in Reno. Crisp crust and loaded with toppings. it was AMAZING!
381	adjudicated	1	Maybe I'll write an updated review bc I really want to try it again but from hearing other people talk about this place, I wasn't that impressed. I got the creole strawberry which tasted like vanilla ice cream with some strawberries (which didn't even taste "in season"). I should have tried some of their other flavors. Maybe next time.
382	adjudicated	1	Decent, consistent food. If you're in the CBD, they make solid food for a quick lunch or happy hour.
383	adjudicated	4	I wish I could write two reviews, because my two experiences here were night and day.  My partner and I went here twice during our trip. The first time was great. Bar was busy, but we snagged a spot to stand and got great service. Between the delicious cocktails (peanut infusion is a real treat), the upbeat music, and friendly patrons and staff, we thought we had found our spot for the rest of our trip.  The second time was much different. Although the bar was pretty empty, the two bartenders ignored us after our first drink order, chatting up and serving other patrons, but letting our drinks sit empty for over 15 minutes, despite our efforts to catch their eye. It appeared they'd determined middle-aged patrons were a better source of tips and saved their charm for them. When one server finally checked in with us (asking abruptly if we were okay, not suggesting another cocktail or anything to make us feel welcome), our mood had been soured and so we passed on the second drink we'd been planning and moved on to Batch up the street, where the cocktails are just as good and the bartender was happy to serve them.  Sad to offer a less than hearty recommendation because our first trip here was so great. Another review here suggested different experiences based on bartenders, so I guess we're not alone in finding up hut and miss. We will peak in the window to identify rage bartender before entering on our next trip,
384	adjudicated	2	Let me start with the positive. The staff and customer service here is exceptional. They will go out of their way to make things right for you and accommodate your needs. However, the hotel facilities they have to work with is in dire need of renovation. The shower in our room dripped all night long; the toilet would not flush properly; consequently it repeatedly overflowed; the tile in the bathroom was broken in several places and dirt had accumulated in the large chipped areas; the facing on the bathroom sink had a huge crack and the toilet paper holder was falling out of the facing; attempts to fix the facing was evident by spackle smeared near the crack and gloves of glue around the toilet paper holder. The furniture in the living are was visibly soiled and the lamp shade in the bedroom was broke.  It's unfortunate that Hilton does not renovate this hotel. The staff was awesome and it would be a shame for them to lose business due to the outdated and falling apart facilities.
385	adjudicated	2	Well maintained and looks clean. More equipped than the Ina/Shannon location. The personal training area however, is monopolized by some bushmaster. Soon as I stepped foot in there she had to jump in and intervene on my workout. Wouldn't even allow me use of a small portion of the floor away from her client session. I am free to workout in the personal training area at the other location which I miss right now since it is being renovated. Other than the bushmaster, it is a great facility.
386	adjudicated	1	I went to Milktooth over the weekend and I really wanted to love it but it was just okay.  I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.    I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.    If you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be "politely declined" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle.   They do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.    I will say that the their menu has changed since they opened and a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews is no longer on the menu.

Our room kind of looks like like a tag sale of furniture acquired between 1970 and 2000, and the grout in the bathroom has turned pretty black.  In fact, it looks just like I remember Sheratons looking when I stayed in them as a kid. And, the fitness center has a ripped up treadmill, loud elliptical, and ceilings not exactly conducive to a tall man lifting weights.  Bright spots were the lemonade at afternoon check-in, the 1875 watt hairdryer, and if we were the wedding (or prom) crashing types, it would be easy at the Sheraton.    Given the choice, I'd stay elsewhere (after a string of bad Starwood experiences, the chain has yet to redeem itself), but hotel rooms were in short supply.

Bean dip is great and salsa is usually very good, although inconsistent.  Food is usually good, although also hit and miss depending on the kitchen staff on a given night. Sit at the bar and talk with long-time bartender Dave. He will keep laughing and well libated. In short,  if you are looking for decent (sometimes very good) food, great margaritas,  and a very good bartender,  this might be your spot. Zero in on one or two menu items and enjoy the drinks and company.

I didn't enjoy the beans that came with them, though. They were a little bitter in my opinion. The rice was dry.  This doesn't affect my view of the place, but the plate was so dang hot! I accidentally touched the edge of the plate with my pinky and burned myself instantly. I now have a fat blister because of it.

From the reviews it seems as though everyone there is great though. I heard through the grape vine and reading other reviews on here they offer you a glass of wine, beer, or rum. But for some reason I was only offered a glass of water or coffee. As a home brewer myself and total beer geek I was totally bummed I wasn't offered the beer but totally got over it with the great service, hospitality, and overall atmosphere there.   Highly recommend this place.  Went back a couple more times, and had a bad experience the last time.

It was a ton of food, but it didn't wow me.  The flavors are kind of bland.  I wish they didn't charge for guacamole.  It's cheap, quick Mexican style food.
392	adjudicated	1	Not value for money. Quantity is very less as compared to the price paid.  Overall Ok restaurant.
393	adjudicated	2	Why is it that ALL Anthros have dressing rooms that seem lit by a candle on the verge of flickering out?  The longer dresses on the first floor are usually amazing.  The rest...well, there are no must-have items anymore. Lack of essential wearability/usefulness seems to be hitting a lot of women's clothing stores these days.
394	adjudicated	2	I ordered the combo vermicelli and was pretty disappointed. The meat portion was very small compared to the huge portion of rice noodle they gave me make it look like there's a lot of food. The combo cake with 2 bland shrimp, 1 eggroll and a few pieces of marinated beef. I also ordered an iced viet coffee which was pretty decent. It wasn't as strong as the ones you would get from 626 or OC area. However, it's pretty good coming from SB. I think they diluted the flavor a bit as well. Overall, I would come back for their viet coffee but not for their main course.
395	adjudicated	1	The food was good and the staff was nice, but we arrives at the start of the breakfast rush and it took a long time to get food to the table.
396	adjudicated	2	Super cute place! Came during lunch and I had the fig salad and it was really good although I'd probably ask for the dressing on the side next time since it was a bit much for me. Would definitely go again for another day date!
397	adjudicated	3	The staff are lovely and the interior is modern, but the food is entirely mediocre. Small portion sizes, which would be fine except that these "tapas" are priced up to $20. The fried chicken was tasty, but the herb garlic chicken was just bizarre in taste. And somehow each dish was topped with the same spring greens mix for no apparent reason than to take up more space on the plate. It's a nice trendy place for a drink, but go only for the atmosphere and not for the food.
398	adjudicated	3	We were staying on Bourbon Street and passed by this place several times. The balcony looked like a cool place to hang out and I love a good burger so we decided to have lunch here. The balcony tables seem to be the first to fill probably because it overlooks Bourbon Street. The hostess seated us at the last available table. We got lucky.    The service was slow. We were here well over an hour. The time between getting our drinks, taking our order, and getting our food was pretty long. Even getting our check took forever but our server was very friendly. It was a good thing we weren't in a hurry.   My husband and I ordered build your own burgers with tater tots. Menu stated two patties with your choice of cheese and condiments. I thought that has to be huge but I didn't see a single patty option. When the burger arrived I realized why it was two patties. They were thin. Mine were very crisp as in overcooked but at least they were warm. My husband's were cold. The tots were ok. The burger was edible but not great which was disappointing considering burger is in the name.
