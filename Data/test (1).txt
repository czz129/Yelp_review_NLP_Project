400	adjudicated	1	Excellent food. Nice location. Only complaint is I requested butter for my pancakes and never got it.
401	adjudicated	1	But, It might be a 2 stars.  All of the staff were great, but the 2 room suite with a small version of a kitchen was more like a 2.  Poorly done "remodel" or just plain in need of remodeling.  Bummer
402	adjudicated	3	Fast food style Greek food.  I would bet most of the 4 or 5 stars are from late night college students after a few drinks.  I would not be afraid to return for lunch as it is quick, clean, priced right, and the food was solid.  However, I have had much better Gyro's and Fries.  Everyone talked about the wings and the staff said they were great, so maybe next time I will go that route and update the review.
403	adjudicated	2	Came in here on a Friday night not really expecting much but to watch the Sixers game. They had a few drink specials, none of which really appealed to me. The mixed drink I got seemed really weak. However, at around 9pm the bartender ABSOLUTELY BLASTED the music to the point where my mate and I paid our check and promptly had to leave. We could still hear the music playing all the way down the street. I don't know if they do that to lure people in or scare them away. I prefer other bars in the neighborhood...
404	adjudicated	1	The Indian cinnamon donuts are delicious!  The rest are just OK, the fancy donuts were nothing to rave about and I had such high expectations for the fried chicken, but it was also pretty standard stuff.  But definitely grab a dozen Indian cinnamons.
405	adjudicated	2	Food was pretty good. Service not so great. Not as fun as the locals make it sound. It is a pretty cool place being on the water.
406	adjudicated	2	This review is for Sunday brunch only. The inside of the inn is beautiful and historic, particularly the Library which is where our large group was seated. The service was great. The brunch offerings, however, were not so impressive. At $26pp, a waffle station would have been nice. Or pancakes. If you wanted eggs, you had to wait at the omelet station. A type of breakfast meat other than pork bacon would have been good also, e.g. turkey sausage, turkey bacon. The vodka penne, chicken francaise, potatoes and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The cookies and other dessert items were not worth the calories or fat content.
407	adjudicated	2	I would have given this 4-stars when it was operated under its former name (which escapes me right now).  The food was still good, but gone are the outstanding individually made margaritas (now they're out of a machine a la "Fat Tuesday" style).  Also was a bit disappointed at our service while sitting at the bar...it was anything but crowded there, yet we waited a disproportionate amount of time for service.  Still not a bad place to go while in Phoenixville.
408	adjudicated	1	An interesting place to visit but, once is enough. Try the West park for better views and more interesting trails, instead. Plus the sunsets in the West park are much better.
409	adjudicated	3	We are still fans of Taco Bus over Casita. It was evening when we arrived, and Casita Taqueria had a few customers. We were met with smiles and a very cheerful, charming staff.  They explained the menu to us and we were left to order.  My wife ordered a Shrimp Casitas bowl and I had the Carne Asada taco and the Barbacoa taco.  The meal came out fast and.... well we weren't blown away at all.  I had been waiting for months to come here to the "Best Taco Place" in St. Pete, but I was disappointed.  My tacos flavors were muddled and colorless, while the hot sauce was missing that wow factor as well.  The shrimp casitas bowl was just "ok" per my wife's review and it too was just missing that something.   So for service, you guys are awesome!  But for the flavor, we just needed that "over the top, next-level", "umami" type of mexican that we have been exposed to lately.
410	adjudicated	2	This is 3 miles away from the main drag of State Street (taxi costs approx $15 to get into 'town').  Rooms are a decent size and the front desk staff were very pleasant.  Coffee, fruit, cookies and water free in the  room.  And the Cal KIng mattress was the most amazing mattress I've ever slept on to be quite frank. We had one unfortunate incident at the restaurant attached to the hotel - 4 of us went to breakfast there this morning. We're English by birth but we've lived in Los Angeles for many years.  However, the restaurant staff heard our English accents and decided that they could take us for a ride with the tip.  When presenting us with the check, they added a 20% tip to the final total.  We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it's a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.  He informed us that many "Europeans" don't know the tipping ettiquette and therefore, they decided to assist us by 'adding 20%" to the check.  His manner and demeanor was completely offensive.
411	adjudicated	2	Well, Chatham Tap is about as inoffensive as a bar can be. It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called "salad"--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.  And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors.   Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.
412	adjudicated	1	Ordered out from here last night.  Nothing spectacular, but the food was good and plentiful.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but since it's in the neighborhood, I may be spending more time here experimenting on other food.  I had the chicken Parmesan (sans cheese).  I really wanted the spaghetti with it, but they ran out before we picked it up, so it came with Lasagna.  It was pretty tasty.  If you are ordering over the phone, be sure to ask them what they have.
413	adjudicated	2	I can't really complain about my stay here. We were in Philly for 5 days and spent the last 3 nights at the Windsor. The room we got was bigger than our apartment in NYC (we upgraded, but i think they accidently gave us a HUGE room, that or the price is just AMAZING).. the king size bed was amazing. We had a balcony, living room, and full kitchen. I wish it would have been a bit more clean and updated. That fitness room is kind of a joke, but i just used the treadmill. The staff seemed friendly and took care of everything we could have asked for. If we come to Philly next summer we will probably stay here again.
414	adjudicated	1	It's a chain but food is solid if your looking for a steak.
415	adjudicated	2	The Grand opening was really nice. They were passing out a lot menu items. They were really good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and congenial. We had the roast beef poboy with mac n cheese. Poor quality. We also had a chocolate malt  really good.
416	adjudicated	3	I've had the pleasure of experiencing Han Dynasty's exquisite Sichuan cuisine in the Old City and University City locations. Today a friend and I decided to try something new. We tried Han Dynasty Cherry Hill.   Good: pea leaves with garlic. These were excellent! Get these! In addition, get the spicy crispy cucumbers  Cold Noodles in Chili Oil: I learned that the taste of the cold noodles depends on the master chef. IMHO, the master chef at the U City location makes a better cold noodle in chili oil dish  Garlic Sauce Style: my friend had this. She said it tasted better at the Old City location.  Ants Climbing a Tree: tasteless  Please read: we expressed our dissatisfaction to the General Manager and he was incredibly responsive. I give the manager 5 stars.
417	adjudicated	4	Came here with my girlfriend on a Monday night and took advantage of the Yelp coupon (which you should too).  Ambiance: Home-y but very small and cramped. Luckily it wasn't too busy on a Monday night. Can't imagine the place packed given it was already hard to hold a conversation given we could hear the other two tables talking around us (BYOB makes everyone a bit louder).  Service: There was one waiter and one busboy working and they had everything covered. Made solid food recommendations and were attentive. Our waiter was also extremely friendly.  Food: Solid italian food. Nothing out of this world, but good. We got a special appetizer - Italian Empanada...Sounds weird, but it was very flaky, delicious party in a slightly spicy marinara. Very delicious. My main entre was the beef osso bucco. The meat was delicious, but don't expect any bone marrow with this dish. My girlfriend ordered a fettucine special which was ok. Noodles were homemade, but the sauce was a little off.  All in all, a reasonably priced Italian BYOB. Just don't come expecting the absolute best italian food.
418	adjudicated	2	This was my first time, but my dining companion has been before and pointed out a few changes. I had the portobello stuffed pretzel and he had the black bean burger. Both were fine. Our complaint was with the sides. The options were Ruffles or store bought pasta salad. My companion said they used to have sweet potato fries so he was really disappointed since that's why we came. I think we'll stick to stopping in for a drink and skip eating there.
419	adjudicated	2	Only good thing about this place are the fries. The burgers are not that special or great. Ordered the double mushroom and got more mushrooms than burger patty. Almost reminds me of a McDonald's burger patty. Even with 2 patties the burger felt mediocre at best. Greasy mushrooms and a soggy bun. Came out to $12 with drink and fries and still felt hungry afterwards. If you want a real burger and fries, try a true authentic local place.
420	adjudicated	2	I've stopped here twice on a Sunday for the lunch buffet. I like the complimentary tea and mango lassi and the food is average. However, each time I've been there a woman (possibly the owner/manager) has been on her cell phone talking nonstop while seating people, while filling water glasses and even while checking people out when leaving. She can't put the phone down to greet or say thank you?  And the entire time we were eating she was on the phone in the back of the restaurant and wasn't very quiet in her conversation. I think next time I try one of the other Indian restaurants in the area.
421	adjudicated	2	Acme in Flourtown is good for a small local grocery store. It's clean, has a fairly decent layout and selection and the staff is pretty good. If you're looking to grab something quick it's the best option close by. (The Genuardis in Flourtown and Acme in Ft Washington both kinda suck)  However, If you're looking to do some heavy, stocking up, grocery shopping you're probably better off heading somewhere else.
422	adjudicated	2	Applebee's isn't really my thing, but I had a gift card, so we stopped in. It was actually pretty good. My wife's portabella chicken was very tasty and perfectly cooked. My bourbon street steak was also cooked nicely, but it did have that weird Applebee's steak texture. The pretzel sticks were a really good appetizer, though. Ceasar salads were fresh and good. Not too shabby, Applebee's!
423	adjudicated	2	This is only based on breakfast. The selection is limited. I was hoping they'd have beignets. In lieu of that, I got coffee, fruit, and bacon - sweet and salty. The coffee was great. The bacon and fruit were sad for $5 each. The bacon was scrawny. The few berries weren't sweet, and the melons were under ripe. As with the hotel itself, the staff were rather muted - not especially helpful or friendly.  If it's raining outside and you're getting ready to leave, stay here for breakfast. Otherwise, go out.
424	adjudicated	3	Not bad, not bad.  Went there for lunch and liked the variety of spice levels.  Also liked that the lunch buffet did not have too many mediocre things, but rather had a dozen well made dishes in smaller batches.  Service was above average and cleanliness is next to excellent.
425	adjudicated	2	The idea is cool,  but the tacos were a bit of a disappointment. We got the chicken, carne asada and fish tacos. The chicken was dry and carne asada was salty so it wasn't full of flavor. The fish taco was good, though! Tender, juicy, and crispy! I don't think the tacos are worth the price, especially since tacos are supposed to be a cheap, simple and delicious food. Overall, I wouldn't go back but it is a cool atmosphere and right in downtown which is convenient.
426	adjudicated	2	My husband and I have been here a number of times and the food is typical beach eatery  I always enjoyed the food. Today , however ,the  platter I ordered was pretty bad. Crab cake , not much crab was lukewarm and mushy, scallops undercooked and fish overlooked and dry. Nothing was hot.  Not going back anytime soon Server was very nice though.
427	adjudicated	3	The good: plush beds, huge flat screen tv, nice toiletries and great location. Very nice staff.  The bad: The hotel was under renovation, so there was construction outside and tarps making a nice courtyard look like a junkyard. We got stuck in the 3rd world country wing ( i think bc we got a cheap rate) where the air system was loud and obnoxious, and the wifi was broken. We had to take an elevator then a stair case to our room. The breakfast everyone raves about is quite mediocre compared to a spread places like the Intercontinental and other upscale hotels put together.
428	adjudicated	3	My husband and I dined here for the first time last night to celebrate his birthday. Here's the breakdown! Atmosphere- This restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn't feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that's the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn't seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere. Service- Our waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount.  Food-  I loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband's salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!  I might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother's day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn't that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!
429	adjudicated	2	I ordered delivery from here 3 times when I wanted sushi, all 3 times the delivery guy instead of knocking or ringing the doorbell just...opened my front door, which scared me to death, another time I waited over 2 hours for my food...and old sushi is not good sushi. Maybe its better to sit and eat at, I only used their delivery service and likely won't be doing so again. But generally speaking they are fine.
430	adjudicated	2	The service is not great here.  It takes a long time for our food to come out.  The food is just ok and I have tried many dishes.  The restaurant is way to loud on the weekends and the tables are to close together.  Not a relaxing atmosphere.  It has a great bar scene....crowded and loud.
431	adjudicated	2	Good food but terrible service. Wait was crazy and there were open tables.  Not a good place to eat at if you have kids!!
432	adjudicated	3	Okay, we were off to a bad start.  Party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids ages 8-12).  It wasn't packed ( but we were packed in a kind of wrap around booth).    We were there an hour before our food was served.  The waitress kept up with drink refills and apologies.  5-stars for her!  When the food finally arrived it was hot and impressive in both taste and presentation.  The burgers were mile-high with toppings, and the kids meals satisfied our big kids. I would say worth the wait but that wait was way too long with no visit from the management.     I'll come back for the Cowboy Burger and hope for the best.
433	adjudicated	2	I got a craving for a turkey burger and was in the area.  It had been over half a year since my last bad experience, so I thought I'd give it another shot.  I am happy to say that I didn't regret it.  I have been back another time since then and the service has been excellent.  Our orders were taken promptly, the correct food arrived, and my burger and fries were hot and fresh.  I tried the mushroom burger with turkey and it was loaded with mushrooms.  The server even brought us fries while we waited because it was taking longer than ten minutes.  She made sure to keep our water glasses full.  If you can, try to sit in Janesca's section, and you will be well taken care of.        The other servers I had gotten bad service from still work there as I saw a few of them walking around.  Hopefully they have improved since my bad experiences.  The only other complaint I have is this place really needs to be dusted!  It doesn't look dirty other than that, but where the carousel horses are along-side the booths is coated with a thick layer of dust.  If they fix that, I would come back more often.
434	adjudicated	3	This place is okay as long as you know what to order. Steaks, chicken, and sandwiches are okay, everything else needs to improve. I am not rating desert here, since these are a safe bet.  Parking at this place is rough, the service is pretty good and makes up for this.  I generally only eat lunch here because the place is not worth the hassle of a dinner crowd.  While I do not go out of my way to go to any Outback, this one is a better one.  Also this location really tries to make improvements and make your experience enjoyable, but the food is average at best.
435	adjudicated	2	Mild was far too spicy. The staff was nice, but the white waiter was pretty inattentive (and partially def I think). Food and prices ok.
436	adjudicated	3	3.5 stars  Hubs and I decided to stop in this place after driving past it on several occasions.  I am very glad we did because we find all kinds of deals here.  Granted, we sometimes "over-shop" because of low prices, but with the savings we are actually breaking even.  How do I know prices are good?  Well I am one of those people that, for whatever reason, tends to memorize prices from my other grocery retailers whether I want to or not.  For example, a 20 ounce Red Bull here is $2.40 while the exact same thing at another store is in the $4.50+ range.    Just this past weekend we bought a Keurig K300 for $80.80.  The same item retailed for over $100 at several other places nearby.  So why just 3.5 stars if I am saving money and am now flush with cash*?  Well the downside is that unlike a typical grocery chain you cannot necessarily find all the brands you are looking for when shopping.  That makes it inevitable that I have to make a trip to a separate store if I have specific needs which cannot be met at IGA.  But I do start my shopping here to get what I can before I go to round two.  The employees are helpful, the place is neat and clean and the prices rock.  *sarcasm - I'm NEVER flush with cash.....
437	adjudicated	1	The entrées and sides in the buffet are nothing special... but the dessert options are better than many restaurants of its kind. Instead of the usual one or two dessert options, they have four--kheer, ras malai, gulab jamun, and jalebi. The jalebi is so delicious; I can only eat a few tiny pieces though, because it is so sweet! If you have a super sweet tooth and love Indian desserts, being content with the pretty average main meal options is worth it to enjoy the sweet highlights.
438	adjudicated	2	Very nice guy, good at giving a solid, sharp haircut, but I didn't feel like he was up to speed on more modern hairstyles. Plus I didn't fee like I got the full barbershop experience: no straight razor for the neck or side part, no blow drying to style my hair, and his products were American crew. Would I go back? Probably. But I'd hope to find a barber that more fits my style.
439	adjudicated	2	We may have visited on an off day. Tacos and gauc were good but no comparison to Funky Taco. $15 for a cold glass of the only Cab Sauv on the menu was disappointing. Seriously, that much for a glass of wine?  Mushroom taco that said was a mix of many mushrooms was all portobellos with one shiitake mushroom? Not ok. Great setting but need to refine quality. Blackened fish taco had no blackening. Might try again, maybe.
440	adjudicated	2	This place has been around forever! Food is pretty good, there's a good bit of variety on the menu as well, so I always try to get something different. If you are in the area, you should definitely stop by if you want tasty food and friendly service.
441	adjudicated	2	The Dosa is pretty decent but honestly the smoke really made my head hurt and made me cough. Made me feel pretty miserable and not hungry. Slow service, restaurant not clean.
442	adjudicated	3	One of the best places on Washington Avenue to sit outside and relax.  A very relaxing atmosphere both inside and out, with service to match.  We enjoyed both outside for people watching and inside for the fireplace and black and white movies on the televisions.   One of the best features of Blondie's is that while the rest of the block is loud and raucous, Blondie's is a nice oasis away from all of this.   Food and drink: Blondie's offers an above average list of wines by the glass, and some very nice beer selections.  I enjoyed several red wines, a cava, and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits.  They also offer a limited menu of smaller plates, charcuterie and the likes, from which I have not ordered.  Given their offerings, I'm sure these are quite nice.  Also a very nice feature is their $4 wine nights on Wednesdays, which is always a plus.  We will definitely be back in the future...
443	adjudicated	2	3 stars means I like it and I'll be back for more. I love Cuban food.  I lived in Tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of Cuban food. I'm excited to have another Cuban place here in Indy. There aren't many.   When I think of good Cuban food, I think of Cuban bread, yucca, plantains, pork and cafe con leche...just to name a few.  Today, we got the Cuban sandwich and the plantains. They were both really good. The portion size of the sandwich was huge. It could easily be shared. The pork and ham were good.  There were two big misses. The biggest miss is the bread. It's just not right. It was almost the consistency of a cracker. It wasn't bad, but ALL of the Cuban bread I've ever eaten was much better. Even if it's pressed, I've never had cracker-like Cuban bread.  Cuban bread is something that I would order as a side, I love it so much. This bread missed the mark.  Maybe I missed it, but there was no yucca on the menu. I really love good Cuban yucca. That was the other miss.
444	adjudicated	3	This place is quick with your dry cleaning but man is it expensive! The location is close to our place, so it makes it convenient, and I must admit like I said above they are super quick at getting your things cleaned. I always keep my eye out for coupons they deliver to our home and those come every couple months - they make my trip to the dry cleaner significantly less expensive!   The staff are there to do there job and that's apparent, there is no idle chit chat - it's get in get out, let's get down to businesses.   Everything I've had cleaned here has been done well so I have no complaints and would recommend this place to friends in the future!
445	adjudicated	2	Met a friend for dinner there about 5pm, based on his recommendation.  We tried some of the craft beer - the porter was very good.  Ordered dinner, ribs and brisket combination.  The brisket was moist and held together well, but not too fatty.  The ribs were flavorful as well.  What was disappointing though, was the portion size.  My friend and I both, almost simultaneously, mentioned how small the serving size was for the price. Our server was prompt, attentive and friendly. Will I go back next time I'm in town?  Probably.  But next time I'll try lunch and a sandwich.
446	adjudicated	2	Silver in the City has some really nice jewelry.  They also have a lot of fun trinkets that would make good gifts--things like Better-Than-A-Boyfriend soap, snarky fridge magnets, and bacon flavored gum.  They also sell some locally made goods, such as purses made from the roof of the old RCA dome.  Somewhat surprisingly, they sell furniture as well.  The location is nice, right next to Starbucks on Mass Ave.  The reason I give it 3 stars is that it seems really overpriced.  I'm not a jewelry expert, so I can't comment on those prices.  They may be quite legitimate.  A lot of the jewelry is really beautiful, and made by artists.  But all of the gifty items cost at least twice what I would have expected.  There may be a reason for this that I'm not aware of--I do know that some items are printed on recycled paper and reused materials.  I respect that.  But other items really seem unreasonable, like the $8 bar of soap or the $20 bento box.  As someone who has to live on a budget, this is a bit of a turn off.  But the place was full of people on a Sunday morning, so maybe I'm just getting old and cranky.  It is obviously a very popular store in Indianapolis.  To each their own, I guess!
447	adjudicated	3	This was my first visit to this location, although we've eaten at several others.  We were a party of 7 adults and 2 children, and were seated in an area with other children, which is fine with me - might as well keep all the noise in one area  :-)  I had the Chicken Jack and Bacon sandwich, which had a good size hunk of chicken in it, along with the cheese, bacon, tomato and onion, but strangely absolutely no sauce or dressing of any kind, making it rather dry.  Other than that, it was good, and everyone else seemed content with their meal.  Our server was attentive and patient, and all our meals were served at the same time, eliminating that awkward "waiting" stage that often happens with larger parties.  However, there was bad news - the children's meal no longer includes a dessert of Dirt and Worms, which (as silly as it may seem) has always been the main attraction of Tony Roma's if kids are along.   We had to pay an extra dollar for a small scoop of freezer-burned vanilla ice cream which neither child finished, nor any adult wanted to eat because of the crystallization of it.  It's funny how Dirt and Worms has become a tradition for us, and the meal didn't seem complete without it.  Hey, Tony, you may have lost some customers over that pudding and cookie crumbs and gummy worm "cost-cutting" elimination.  Others may value you for your ribs, but for us it was the giggles over chocolate-covered faces that made us leave with a smile on our faces.
448	adjudicated	3	The theme of the resturant is a lot of fun with all of the prohibition photographs and other fun decor. The food and drinks were all pretty good but the one thing that would make me not come back to this restaurant are the overly high chairs and tables. My entire party had to literally climb up into the chairs and then you feel like you are jumping down when you had to get out of the chair. At one point one person in our party went to the restroom and came back and stood the rest of the time because they said it was too hard to get back into the high chair. These were handmade and the person who made them neglected to use proper height measurements for high top tables and chairs. They are a safety hazzard.
449	adjudicated	3	Stopped in here for dessert tonight after reading great reviews. I would have given it 4 stars except our experience dropped a star off.  We arrived just after 9pm and closing time is 11pm so plenty of time remaining open. The only thing was that the staff were already packing up and cleaning floors, equipment ect...  I queried closing time as thought maybe times wrong online but he said no it's 11pm!  I just found it uncomfortable sitting and eating whilst they clean and pack up although have 2 hours work remaining!?!  Saying all that the ice cream was really good and a great range of flavours. The ice cream was tasty and generous servings were good although at nearly $5 for 2 scoops it's a little bit expensive.
450	adjudicated	2	Walk around inside and soak up the history. Talk to the guy selling shirts outside, he has some amazing stories to tell. They love jazz there and you can see it in their eyes.   People who don't even like jazz walk away after spending some time there and talk about the fun and newfound appreciation for this American creation.   Wear loose clothing in the summer and try to ignore just how BAD everything around the area smells. It's worth it.
451	adjudicated	2	Drexel/Penn student joint. Good for a quick swing in for take-out or a buffet plate. Nothing to write home about. Reasonable prices and quality.
452	adjudicated	2	We did enjoy the food here.  I had a shrimp Po' Boy and it was very good.  The portions are a little small.  The really bad thing was that is was their crawfish boil day so most of the things on the menu weren't available to order.  I guess this is because of the crawfish boil.  The Mom of the place was pretty rude and opinionated.  The son, however, was a charming guy.  He was very nice and gave us some of the potatoes and other items to try from the crawfish boil.  We will go back sometime, I am sure.
453	adjudicated	3	First, location...if you are staying near the French quarter, this place is a little bit of a hike but for a calmer night in New Orleans, this is a great spot.  The crowd is mainly 30+ year olds that appreciate great wine, cheese and jazz.   The layout is a but odd though. You walk through a wine shop and can buy your own bottles and cheese. You choose your sizes and cheese types from their fridge.  Then you go into a cool backyard patio area where there is a live band and pick a seat. For food, there is a small window to order from which is CASH ONLY.  The food is ok. It's not the best of NOLA but it is tasty.  The portion sizes are very good for the price.  I'd definitely come back for ambiance, wine and cheese but maybe not a full meal.
454	adjudicated	4	It was a pretty cute little restaurant; the atmosphere was definitely "neighborhood pub."  We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she's not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I'm jealous!    As is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one's hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two "stalls" in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!  When the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia's injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I'm not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It's a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.     The dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.   The lamb was a big disappointment, it was a little sour (bad?).  The collard greens were pretty standard, nothing amazing.
455	adjudicated	3	One word: MEH  Had dinner here Sunday Night...It's nice decoration and everything and the chef is funny but it's just for that money I've had more  delicious and entertaining hibachi. Good to go occasionally tho.
456	adjudicated	2	Completely UNDERWHELMED........ Love John Besh, but he wasn't fooling me--that was étouffée sauce on the shrimp and grits!  If I wanted étouffée, I would have order it. Food was okay, but VERY expensive.
457	adjudicated	1	Good food. Non dependable delivery service which sucks in a town with scarce parking. For that reason I go elsewhere.
458	adjudicated	1	This is a standard Best Buy.  The staff in the games section was helpful and amiable.  Other than that it is mediocre on every level.
459	adjudicated	3	The service was very good and our food came out pretty quickly. The food was just so-so though. My grain salad (Farro?) has crunchy bits like it was undercooked or left out to harden. My husband has the chicken and said it was dry. Honestly not a terrible meal, but at $17 a plate it was not worth the price.
460	adjudicated	1	Not bad with the crawfish dish. Really laid back during the day but after 6 forget me being there. U become a number
461	adjudicated	3	Very good sushi.  I would give this place more stars if the dining experience on a peak night was better.  It's a small restaurant so it's tight in there.  What bothers me is that the waitresses don't seem to have a problem bumping into you, or rubbing their asses on your chair consistently throughout the night just to walk by.  I gave the startled look many times and they didn't give a crap.  Happened many times.  Just unacceptable. The place is good though.
462	adjudicated	3	Beautiful shop; hands down one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's very modern and chic in a way. Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV!   We couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)  To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fiancée's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.  Iffy on whether or not we'll be back. I want to like this place, but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking.
463	adjudicated	1	Incredible wine and booze selections. Clean and organized. Sadly the produce was terrible. Bad oranges and peaches in Florida??? That was disappointing.
464	adjudicated	1	Very overpriced for literally HALF a panini. Incredibly disappointed. Won't be back. Forty bucks for me and the kids and even the kids were still hungry.
465	adjudicated	2	Truly delicious and generously-sized burgers! The fries are superb-great pub food. The prices are a little steep. The service is fine. My go-to spot to dine and talk for hours and it's never been too busy where that would be an issue.
466	adjudicated	3	We stopped by here around 2:00 pm on Saturday and the place was hoppin!  We were promptly seated, so I had a few minutes to look over the place before we ordered the food.  Ambiance:  I have stated before in my reviews that I absolutely loathe it when restaurants rely on big screen TVs for entertaining.  They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?    FOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.  Overall, I'm glad I came, but neither the food or ambiance did anything to scream "Come back, Allie!"
467	adjudicated	2	99% of the time I love Whole Foods. This week and last week, though, I am quite disappointed. We drive a distance to come to shop here so we always eat from the salad bar. Two weeks in a row, there is no vegan salad dressing available. They usually have 4 vegan options. Last week I didn't discover that they were out until after I had made my salad. When I asked about it, the gentleman said "we're out til Monday. " He didn't seem concerned or offer any alternatives so I gave him my salad and left.  This week, still no salad dressing, but I looked before I made my salad, and I purchased my own vegan dressing. Come on Whole Foods. Please don't disappoint me again.
468	adjudicated	2	Note: This is not a fast food place. Expect to wait about 15-20mins for a sandwich & fries. I had the turkey with avocado, etc & it was ok. Could have used more aioli, so it was a little dry since the bread is thick. The fries are the size of McDonald's & are garlicky. Wolfgang is a better choice health wise. However, was it worth the $11.99 + tax, not in my opinion but it is the airport. Idk what other places are around, but I'll explore more the next time.
469	adjudicated	2	Reasonably priced spot with good beer and food selection. I tried the PO Boy with sauté onions and red peppers - food was good and the fries were great (note don't use ketchup as they are tasty by itself).
470	adjudicated	3	It was ok. I wasn't all that into the buffet. The food was bland, however,  it was fresh. I loved the history photos on their walls and I love the tile designs on the ceiling. Food was just ok and bland my waitress was normal. Very small inside so grab your seats when you can.
471	adjudicated	3	I have been driving passed Fellini's on West Chester Pike for some time now. Today I decided that it was time to stop by and have lunch here. The lunch prices are great, most meals average around $10. They offer a good selection of choices for lunch... pasta dishes, antipasto, salads, pizzas, paninis etc. I opted for a Panini- the "El Patrizio". Which consisted of grilled chicken, portobello mushrooms, spinach and provolone. When I think of a panini, I picture a sandwich all melted together with grill marks on the sides of the bread. This was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread. It also came with lettuce, tomato and onions on it, which I was not aware came with the panini. The sandwich tasted good, just not what I had expected. It came with a side salad (great honey mustard dressing) and homemade chips (favorite part of my meal).  I left full and satisfied. I felt that I definitely got my moneys worth out of this meal. I would return!
472	adjudicated	2	The food is pretty good and the service is very nice. However the entrees are very expensive.  $16.99 plus tax for an entree (chicken and rice with garlic bread) .   Its good just not worth it for me. I haven't tried the buffet so I may come back to try the buffet but not the entree.
473	adjudicated	1	I come here once in awhile to check out their clearance stuff in electronics.. and I did find a portable charger for my iphone 4 for only $22 !!  which was a deal considering that elseware it sells for $70!!
474	adjudicated	3	I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.  Starting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.  The prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:  --purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: "Yeah, we're actually out of half and half." Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no "I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute." That was it. The guy behind us asked, "is anyone going to get some more?" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP.   --another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they "actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened.   --this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me).   Jersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.
475	adjudicated	2	It was ok....Did like the homemade potato chips. Had to wait 10 mins after asking for the check as the waitress was talking with other guess. But food was good.
476	adjudicated	2	The ambience and decor were nice. The nachos were good, along with a few choice options. However, do not order a cheeseburger. It is not only tiny, but it looks like something that was dropped off the back of a McDonald's truck as it was driving through a bad neighborhood. It was over cooked, dry, and just plain nasty. I was very disappointed to find such a flop in a restaurant that seems to be filled with blockbusters. The overall experience was fine, but that burger sure did ruin it.  The fries were another disappointment all their own.
477	adjudicated	3	stayed here two nights.  The hotels best attribute is the location. Close to historic sites, bars, restaurants.  Other than that, its a mediocre hotel at best. Not much decor, rooms are standard  size. The bed isnt too comfortable. Small bathroom.  We did hit up the pool which is on the 4th floor. Its a 4 foot pool decent enough to hang out and take a dip.  Essentially you will be paying for the location. Parking is 36 bucks a day so be warned!  Overall the stay was good. The front desk is helpful but the hotel rooms were definitely forgetable.
478	adjudicated	2	2nd time here on Saturday at 6. Reservations were for 615 seated at 7 PM. Hostess said 20 minute wait, significantly underestimated. Same thing happened first time around. Understaffed. Squeeze you in at each table.12 people at each table only room for nine. Not enough room for dishes and drinks. Food is good but everything else below acceptable.
479	adjudicated	2	Visited Richard's for brunch Saturday 2/18. Good service, but shockingly first bad meal we have had there, and we were long time frequent Cafe Vicino patrons before their move and rebranding. Potatoes that came with my eggs and bacon, and my wife's eggs and sausage we're OVERsalted to the point of being inedible. Toast was cold upon delivery. Hope this was a one-off.
480	adjudicated	4	Nice brunch spot located in Northern Liberties. Saw a segment of Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives a couple years ago that highlighted HS&E, so this place has been on my radar for a quite a while. If you go on the weekend, expect a wait. I waited about 30 mins, which in the grand scene of things wasn't that bad. The place is small inside, but they do have outdoor seating. The food and service were good. I had the eggs benedict, which is really not a 'go to' for me, but I was feeling adventurous. The eggs benedict was good as was the 4th St. Corn. The service was good. I did have to remind my waiter a second time to bring me a lemonade, but it was pretty busy. I would return and try something else on the menu.
481	adjudicated	2	Pedicure here was excellent, no problem with the services offered. However, I walked in on a different day for a fill and the staff basically ignored me.  The guy actually seemed annoyed that I was there, told me to wait and then never got back to me. I sat there for at least 10 minutes without a word.  I left and won't be going back. I can get a good pedicure somewhere else with someone who actually values my business.
482	adjudicated	2	A local favorite. Worth trying at least once. The staff is usually pretty friendly. Be prepared to wait on a weekend.   The service is the best thing going. The food selection is pretty large. Diner food with a sprinkle of greek influence. I've found some of the food items to not be so fresh.  It seems like they must use lard or butter on everything because every time I left my stomach just felt extremely heavy for hours.  If you go, plan for a nap and tums after.
483	adjudicated	2	Dots Diner is like coming home.  Friendly and attentive staff along with very good Diner food.   I've had breakfast here several days while working and they have exceeded my expectations every day.  Whether your here on pleasure or work there is no better place to start your day than Dots Diner.   Truth in dining leads me to report a less than favorable experience after a string of very good ones.  This morning I arrived at 5:30 am as usual and to be honest it was not the same staff that I had seen for the previous two weeks.   After sitting in acknowledged for seven minutes I left and drove up the street where I had a fantastic experience.    It's good to be great but there is something to be said for consistency too.  I won't let one underwhelming experience get me too down on Dots.
484	adjudicated	2	It's OK, but as someone from Texas that knows her barbecue this will not be a place that I return to. It's pricey for what it is and it's just not that great. The service was really good and the drinks are pretty awesome. But if you're looking for authentic barbecue at average/market price, this isn't it. This is more of a barbecue style of their own and it's pricey. It has a cool location, and the service is friendly and prompt.
485	adjudicated	2	Slow...not as amazing the last few times I have been.  The tomatoes are still excellent, the fruit still the same, and the ideas still fresh.  But sometimes there are a stale lettuce pieces in the salad, and it can be like sit-down-and-read-a-book times. Still a great choice, but I think the sheer traffic from the groupon or whatever with one or two staff only can lead me to not be quite as delighted as before.  Still good as a local coffee place.
486	adjudicated	3	While I like that this HMV location sells vinyl, they do have it priced quite high.  I guess this is for the people who want to purchase LPs but only doing their shopping at the mall (vs. hitting the independents on Whyte) and don't mind paying a little more for their vinyl.   As for other items - CDs/DVDs/Books/BluRays -  if the item is on sale, then it is usually a good price, and most popular items are on sale.  Any item that is not on sale (the more unusual selections, or less popular items) is usually way overpriced.  Being the largest HMV in the city, the selection is pretty good, though I do find they still fall into that "stock only the GREATEST HITS or BEST OFs instead of back catalogue" mentality that all chains seem to buy into.  Staff is friendly and the lines are quick - this can be a pretty busy location - so if you need to buy from HMV, this is a good location.
487	adjudicated	1	Good customer service. Bill was very accommodative. They were able to replace my brake pads in about an hour and send me on my way.
488	adjudicated	1	Typical Mongolian style restaurant with lots of options and a fun twist on dining.
489	adjudicated	3	Care more about your customers. I went to fresh healthy cafe for a mid morning smoothly with my wife. There was no one in the restaurant when we got there. I ordered a smoothy and my wife ordered a latte and a parfait. The parfaits are premade and quite good. The latte came out just as she was finishing her parfait (5 minutes ish), I continued to wait at least a couple of more minutes for my smoothy. I could have made it faster at home. When I did get it, it was not worth the wait. There was far too much ice... They give you a wide slurpy straw to make up for the increased ice volume, it's just not the consistency I like and had very little flavour because if the high ice volume.  It's nice to see a healthy option place in my new neighbourhood, but I hope that they vastly improve their service and quality.
490	adjudicated	1	I have no idea what these people are talking about. This place is disgusting. I'm from San Antonio Texas, so I know what   Mexican food is supposed to taste like. I'm not expecting New Orleans to have outstanding Mexican food, but this place is completely gross. Eat at your own risk.
491	adjudicated	3	Look, I like the place and featured donuts did not disappoint.  But lets be honest with a line like that, how does a selfie happen?  Huh?  St. Louis?  Huh?  Strange Donuts?  I find that a little unusual and now my near perfect selfie-foursquare check in ratio has been irreconcilably tarnished so I'm taking a star off because selfie in the age of Mark Zuckerberg, in the age of Obama you're gonna have a shop too crowded to take a decent selfie?  PALEESE.  Also they have no paleo/gluten free options so another star off, I mean WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FEED MY FOUR AND SIX YEAR OLD?!
492	adjudicated	0	Big ups to the girls who thought my puppy was so cute, they gave her free treats!
493	adjudicated	2	A pho place that checks all the boxes but doesnt have the best of anything.  We went to Lily's the day before, so I guess this review is a compare and contrast.  Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.
494	adjudicated	3	Stopped by for lunch with a group, so didn't get to experience the belly-dancers.  Most in the group ordered the gyros - wihch were decent.  Service was a little slow - possibly because of the large group size.  Good ambience, average to better food, slower service.
495	adjudicated	3	We have been on many cruises on other lines but, we wanted to take our Grandson on a nice trip and figured the Carnival Dream would be a good choice because of the Teen Club they offer. Booking the cruise was fairly easy. The embarkation and disembarkation went fairly well also. The cruise turned out fine for our Grandson but, there were a few things we didn't like. We knew this was going to be a younger crowd and the activities would be geared to that age group but, we were disappointed that there was not a little more available to the older folks as we noticed there were many families traveling with what looked to be older parents and grandparents. The food in the main dining rooms was fine and so was the Lido. The problem in the Lido was that they made you stand in line for everything and the lines were long and slow. The two pools were also very small for that size ship. So small that one could barely find a space to even stand in the water. The stateroom was very nice. It was a good size with a comfortable bed and a step in shower. The three ports were well chosen and there were more than adequate excursions to choose from. Overall, it was what we expected and our Grandson had a very good time which is what really matters.
496	adjudicated	3	If you want anything fresh, you gotta come here early, or else you're going to find yourself waiting for the pastries to bake or just have none at all.  I'm very bad with the names of pastries, but I can say that I definitely like the Guava turnover, bearclaw, almond croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.  I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit.   I had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm.   That being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn't for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there's no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you're having a bad day, don't take it out on the customers.  If you want coffee, I would go across the street to Starbucks or down the road to PJ's, but if you don't mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery.
497	adjudicated	2	So I walked up to the Cajun Grill while trying to grab something quick to go. This place reminded me of a place at the mall back home so I had an idea of the taste that would soon be tantalizing my tongue.  The price points were perfect and some locals who obviously frequent the restaurant in the food court kept singing CG's praises. Unbeknownst to them, I'd already been sold and was buying.  The bourbon chicken was extremely tasty and the portion sizes seemed like a lot when comparing to the typical amount of chicken and/or lamb over rice received at a normal NYC Halal stand.  I was definitely pleased with my purchase and had a difficult time trying to limit the amount of rice I ate. Yes I ended up eating it all, against my original intent. LOL
498	adjudicated	4	Been here a few times over the years, mainly when I'm at the hotel for an event. As far as hotel connected restaurants go, this place isn't too bad at all. They have a very nice setup, with sections far enough apart so that the restaurant isn't overly loud when the bar is busy. The staff are usually very friendly, and keep your drinks filled. The place has a great atmosphere and can be a good spot to catch a ball game. Some of there specials are tempting, especially when they have half priced starters.  The food here is about what you would expect. Efficient, hot, served quickly but nothing that will knock your socks off. I'd recommend the burgers and just about any of the fried dishes. Most of the starters are good, especially the wings. The BBQ is passable, but nothing to get excited for. Certainly aren't many good alternatives for BBQ in the area, so this place could definitely do the trick. Just please beware that if you're dining with a large party, your BBQ will likely be a bit on the dry side by the time it comes out, happened on multiple occasions. If you're there with just one or two other people, then you won't have to worry.  Bottom line is that if you're staying at the Holiday Inn that this is connected to, you can get a decent meal, some good drinks with a nice atmosphere. Good without being great, but never slid into bad territory. I'd probably lean closer to 3.5 Stars, but not higher than that.
499	adjudicated	3	Voted one of the most romantic restaurants in Santa Barbara. It could have been if it wasn't for a wedding reception when we went... There were kids running and place was very loud. Not the restaurant's fault, of course.  Food is just OK.. nothing spectacular.. I need a redo.
